This `Dockerfile` will install OpenLDAP and LDAP utilities, configure the OpenLDAP server with the provided environment variables, and start the OpenLDAP service on ports 389 (LDAP) and 636 (LDAPS).

Note that you should replace the values of the environment variables with the appropriate values for your LDAP configuration. Once you have created the `Dockerfile`, you can build the Docker image with the following command:

docker build -t my-ldap-image .


And then you can run a container from the image with the following command:

docker run -d --name my-ldap-container -p 389:389 -p 636:636 my-ldap-image


This will start the OpenLDAP service inside the container and expose the LDAP and LDAPS ports on the host.
