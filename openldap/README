This `Dockerfile` will install OpenLDAP and LDAP utilities, configure the OpenLDAP server with the provided environment variables, and start the OpenLDAP service on ports 389 (LDAP) and 636 (LDAPS).


These will insert four organizations (`org1`, `org2`, `org3`, and `org4`), four groups (`group1`, `group2`, `group3`, and `group4`), and four users (`user1`, `user2`, `user3`, and `user4`) into the OpenLDAP directory.

Once the container is running, you can use an LDAP client, such as `ldapsearch`, to verify that the organizations, groups, and users have been inserted correctly:

~~~
ldapsearch -x -D cn=admin,dc=mydomain,dc=com -w secret -b dc=mydomain,dc=com
~~~

This command will list all entries in the `dc=mydomain,dc=com` subtree of the OpenLDAP directory. You should see the four organizations, four groups, and four users that you inserted in the output.

Note that you should replace the values of the environment variables with the appropriate values for your LDAP configuration. Once you have created the `Dockerfile`, you can build the Docker image with the following command:

~~~
docker build -t my-ldap-image .
~~~

And then you can run a container from the image with the following command:
~~~
docker run -d --name my-ldap-container -p 389:389 -p 636:636 my-ldap-image
~~~

This will start the OpenLDAP service inside the container and expose the LDAP and LDAPS ports on the host.
